# CardDefender AI: Multi-Model Fraud Detection Engine

CardDefender AI is an end-to-end machine learning system designed to
detect fraudulent credit card transactions with high accuracy. The
engine leverages multiple ML models, advanced preprocessing techniques,
and thorough evaluation metrics to deliver a reliable and scalable fraud
detection solution.

## Features

-   Multi-model architecture (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM,
    etc.)
-   Complete preprocessing pipeline
-   Handling of highly imbalanced fraud data
-   Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
-   Feature engineering & transformation
-   Model comparison and performance benchmarking
-   Fraud prediction with high precision & recall
-   Clean and modular workflow

## Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing

-   Missing value handling
-   Scaling & normalization
-   Feature encoding
-   Class imbalance correction (SMOTE / undersampling)

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

-   Transaction pattern exploration
-   Fraud vs Non-fraud distribution
-   Correlation analysis
-   Visualization of trends & anomalies

### 3. Model Development

Models implemented: - Logistic Regression - Random Forest Classifier -
SVM - Decision Tree - KNN - XGBoost (if used)

### 4. Model Evaluation

Metrics: - Accuracy - Precision - Recall - F1-score - ROC-AUC -
Confusion Matrix

### 5. Fraud Prediction Engine

Classifies: - Fraudulent transactions - Legitimate transactions

## Technologies Used

-   Python
-   Pandas, NumPy
-   Scikit-Learn
-   Matplotlib, Seaborn
-   Imbalanced-Learn
-   Jupyter Notebook

## Future Enhancements

-   Deploy using Flask / FastAPI
